# 🏷️ IntelliTag - Automatic Question Tagging System

An AI-based application that automatically analyzes questions and predicts relevant tags using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** techniques.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ⚡ **Automated Tagging**: Uses advanced NLP and deep learning (LSTM, BERT) for tag prediction.
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Techniques**: Implements PyTorch and TensorFlow for model training and inference.
- 🌐 **Modern Web Stack**: Frontend built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS**, and **Bootstrap**.
- 💻 **Robust Backend**: Developed using **Flask** (Python) to serve the trained model.
- 🗄️ **Database Integration**: Uses **MySQL** for storing questions and tags.
- 📊 **Real-Time Results**: Provides tag suggestions instantly via a clean, user-friendly interface.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. User enters a question.  
2. The question is preprocessed using NLP techniques.  
3. The trained deep learning model (LSTM/BERT) predicts relevant tags.  
4. Results are stored in the database and rendered in the frontend.
